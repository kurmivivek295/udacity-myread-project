Udacity Myreads Book tracking App Code

## Udacity Project Overview
In the MyReads project, you'll create a bookshelf app that allows you to select and categorize books you have read, are currently reading, or want to read. The project emphasizes using React to build the application and provides an API server and client library that you will use to persist information as you interact with the application.

### Specification
In this application, the main page displays a list of "shelves" (i.e. categories), each of which contains a number of books. The three shelves are:

* Currently Reading
* Want to Read
* Read

## How to use the app

    ```
    $ git clone git@github.com:kurmivivek295/udacity-myread-project.git

3. Go inside application directory and Serve the application:
